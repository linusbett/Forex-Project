<h5>How to auto-copy forex trades without needing the vps(fx prime traders answers</h5>
<details>
<summary>Copy Trading is a the easiest and  simplest way of participating in forex trading with almost zero knowledge and skills of trading.Why? Well my friend this is what happens You simply replicate the forex trades placed by  experienced professional traders directly into your own forex account in real-time.Whenever that  experienced professional trader makes his or her  trade, your personal forex account will make that similar trade.How nice?Read more</summary>
<p>So this means your forex trading will be completely automatic,others say you are auto-trading.You will not be required to do hectic fundamental analysis ,technical analysis, trying to figure out how hundreds of technical indicators work, leave alone their complex and funny names.This will really save you the time to do your other important hustles, spend time with family and friends while your forex account is making money for you automatically when you are a sleep, walking etc in short your forex copy trading account will be your passive money making machine in 24 hours of your day, this is really awesome.
You will set aside a proportion of your funds in your forex brokers account  to your selected strategy provider/ trader to replicate his/her  trade, and then real-time open positions are copied directly using that proportion  which is  the same percentage  as the strategy providers/trader.If your strategy provider  uses 3% of their margined  account balance to make a forex trade, your account will also make the same trade with similar percentage of the money you apportioned to that trader.
Copy trading has proved to be more reliable than manual trading over the years since the inception of the technology,I am telling you and I mean it that this brought a significant relief to my trading styles in this forex industry.I used to glue my self on my table trying to perform endless fundamental and technical analysis of the forex market accross the globe,I was also number one victim of information overload about the economic news from major business media houses and all in all I lost my money so much and blew my account three times.Statistics wise the success rate of guys  who use copy trading compared to the manual traders  show that people who diligently  choose their strategy providers while carefully considering their  statistics, trading histories ,types of forex strategies and portfolio are performing up to 10% more  than people who trade manually.
Copy trading is designed and best fit for new traders who don't have so much knowledge about forex trading and for their own personal reasons they don't have time or interest to learn more about trading.The Zulu copy trading plartform facilitates your trading in the forex market to provide you with a nice opportunity of making profits for yourself without skills to trade the forex Market.Zulu rank will show you the profiles of 'millions' of traders with great transparency of their perfomance and strategies so it's just upto you to choose your preffered trader, you will make a loss my friend if you choose a joker to copy his or her trades in your real account. Since Zulu copy trading plartform gives you some control over the trades by providing you with the charts, you will not have to fully depend  in your chosen  trader if you trust yourself in manual trading.
Before we proceed much further,copy trading is mostly confused with mirror trading, social trading and PAMM accounts.Its best we compare and differentiate them first.Okay let's begin;
<h4>COPY TRADING vs MIRROR TRADING</h4>
Copy trading is very similar to mirror trading but vary on the processes involved to get the trades replicated in the slave account of the copier, now you who wants to receive such trades.In copy trading the master account/the account of the strategy provider has to submit his signals or strategies from his or her account to the  copy trading company/plartform for recording by connecting his or her account electronically, now the copier of the trade/the slave account will  read the perfomance of the strategy provider  on the company rankings and from there choose the signals to be replicated in his or her account by Also connecting to the company.Whereas With mirror trading the company/plartform itself has the signals and sends the orders to the slave accounts.
<h4>COPY TRADING vs SOCIAL TRADING</h4>
Social trading is the term that now stands for both copy trading and mirror trading.Like social media accounts the traders profiles are displayed for the investors to choose one of them to copy their trades.Just like social media it also involves the person to person sharing of knowledge, ideas, opinions, fundamental news,and trending economic developments that influence the financial markets especially the forex industry.The traders and investors are facilitated to make their own personal profiles to distribute  their forex trading operations,to educate others on various economic trends and their overall impacts on global financial markets,to comment on others and finally to stimulate useful and relevant conversations in which the trading community can participate.From here investors choose to invest on people who are the strategy providers now rather than the products themselves.
<h4>COPY TRADING Vs PAMM</h4>
PAMM( Profit Allocation Money Module)  together with LAMM(Lot Allocation Money Module) is a managed account service,both are part of the MAM(Managed Account Module) services.Back to PAMM forex services, the investors deposit their funds in a pool of funds and can only be withdrawn at predetermined times,the fund manager is entrusted with the investors funds and trades with their pool of funds in the forex markets.The investors sign the LPOA(Limited power of attorney) agreement giving the fund manager limited permission to trade with their money.The profits that are made are then distributed to individual investors in the percentage proportion of their investments in the pooled funds.
Let's get alitle bit practical and do some maths, please it's just a few simple multiplications and ratio stuffs, like four sentences if you have a phobea with numbers  for that reason just pardon me.For instance three passionate forex investors Immaculate,Nancy,Sonya and Cindy decide to contribute their money to a PAMM fund manager.Now these investors  contribution to the total pooled PAMM fund of €150,000,each of the three investor has the following share in terms of percentage;

Immaculate = €40,005 / €150,000 = 26.67% and similarly,

Nancy =€34,995/€150,000= 23.33%

Cindy=€25,005/€150,000 =16.67%

Sonya=€49995/150,000= 33.33%
The total percentage of the pooled funds in the PAMM account is 100% With the same percentage of share in the PAMM forex account of the investors money,so will they share on profits discovered by the trades placed by the fund manager.
Benefits of copy trading to PAMM
Copy trading plartform has several advantages that PAMM account lacks, first in copy trading the investors have more control over their money,they can withdraw their funds from the strategy provider at the copy trading plartform at will, the investors in copy trading also have the freedom to adjust their risk management parameters anytime during their investment periods,copy trading offers a wide range of products such as commodities, stocks,ETF's options and indices to invest,it is not limited only to forex as is the case to PAMM.Further more PAMM accounts require big minimum deposits locking out many investors with lower budget investments needs.PAMM accounts have restrictions on withdrawals of the funds,it has to be within a predetermined time.

<h4>Benefits of PAMM account to copy trading</h4>
Trades in copy trading are executed in the master account of the strategy provider and the trade gets copied to the slave account by mean of electronic auto-trading programs.This replication of trades is done remotely by the programs such that the trader executed the trade firs in his or her account which is later transferred to the investors account this doesn't happen in perfect timing and their is always a delay in the system of fractions of seconds resulting to differences in entry and exit of the market and less profits.This particular problem is called the latency/Slippage.Now if the Signal provider and the investor are using different brokers, brokers pricing is not always perfectly the same in the world this worsens the slippage condition resulting to reflection of different trading results between the trader and investor's account.However the Slippage problem is a foreign language to PAMM account account investors. Additionally PAMM accounts are considered to be more passive forex investment to less experience forex traders compared to copy trading.
<h4>Zulu Guard fx copy trading Risk Management</h4>
Well,as a serious investor you need to shield your hard earned money from avoidable risks,you know it's your sweat.So setting the lot size parameters of your forex trading account is quite important.A lot in Zulu trade forex is the number of units of currencies that you can buy or sell in the financial markets.The lot size settings on your Zulu trade account settings will determine your risks undertakings and the percentage of your funds apportioned to your trader for trades.
Your Zulu trade forex  account plartform has three types of lot sizes, these are the standard lot,mini lot and micro lot.One standard lot in forex comprises of 100,000 units of currencies sold or bought in the market.One mini lot comprises of 10,000 currencies units while a mini lot comprises of 1000 units of currencies that your trader sells or buys in the global currencies market.

Zulu Guard protection is a feature on your Zulu Guard copy trading app that allows you to set up your customized risk parameters that Zulu trade plartform implements to safeguard your hard earned money.Zulu guard has three features that is;the Zulu Guard Capital protection,Zulu Guard take profit and finally the Zulu capital protection notification.Now let's take a look at the first one.
<h4>(1) ZuluGuard Capital Protection:</h4>
This setting involves determining the total sums of money you are willing to risk to a particular trader in your Zulu trade plartform.So your preffered maximum amount of money that you are ready to loose Incase the market goes against you since the traders are also humans determined here and the plartform will automatically block any further replication of the traders strategies in your fx copy trading account.For instance if you set the Zulu capital protection to be at € 400 and your preffered trader makes a loss of €400 the system will intervene and shield you from further losses exceeding the set amount.Equally if your preffered trader makes a profit of €2000 and his next trade closes at at a loss of € 400, the Zulu capital protection will intervene by locking in your Profit of € 1600.This feature that your fx copy trading equity amount is 24-7 monitored and protected.

<h4>(2)Zulu Guard take profit</h4>
This is simply Zulu Guard feature that locks in your predetermined amount of profit in real money value if the amount is reached.
Simply tell ZuluGuard the monetary amount you wish to secure! When this profit is reached, ZuluGuard™ will be triggered! For instance if you set your take profit amount at € 1000.If your preffered trader in the platform closes all his or her open positions making a total profits PnL(total PnL=realized + floating) that reaches your € 1000 value,Zulu guard take profit feature will intervene for you automatically by closing all the traders open positions,disabling your trader and lock in for you the € 1000.You have the option of re-enabling your trader again to replicate his strategies in your Zulu trade forex copy trading account by configuring the Zulu guard settings.
<h4>(3) Zulu guard capital protection notification</h4>
This Zulu guard feature is just nice for you, you will get an email notification when your specified Percentage of the capital protection amount of money you have set for your trader is reached by your used capital (realized + floating PnL) that you had set for your particular trader.This email notification will alert you to closely monitor your trader, for example if your Zulu guard capital protection notification was set at €2000 and your notification settings are at 50% .If your used capital apportioned to your particular trader reaches 50%(-€1000) you will instantly receive this email so that you may start to carefully monitor this trader.

Another important thing is apportioning the number of Lots to entrust to each of your Trader
You can assign each of your trader your own preffered number of currency  lots that they can trade for you based on their past reputation,historical Performances and risk appetite.Well, your Zulu trade plartform has this most useful configurations for doing that.This are fixed mode allocation and Pro-rata allocation.

<h4>(1)Fixed mode</h4>
In this type of settings you will apportione the number of lots you entrust to each of your Zulu trade strategy provider manually.For instance assigning 1 micro lot in a $ USD Zulu trade account will mean that if they trade the USD pair currency with another currency you will make a profit/loss of $0.1 per 1 pip move.So if you make a good profit 200 pips you will make $20 in profit real monetary value in your account.
<h4>(2)Pro-rata mode</h4>
This setting basically means that you set the percentage proportion of lot size of your currencies trade that will be copied from the amount of trades your signal provider will open.The point here is it it is in percentage.For instance if you set it at 10% and your signal provider opens 1 standard lot, consequently 1 mini lot (=0.1 x 1 standard lot) will be opened in your trading account.
The advantages of copy trading
Well,in order to successfully trade manually, you will really have to train your self for a long period of time.It is hectic experience first of all to get to know the indicators with some funny names for technical analysis.Additionally you will have to learn how to use and optimize the indicators so that you can make good use of them leave alone their mathematical settings.Well the market also moves based on important major economic news that you should be up to date always in order to make prudent fundamental analysis of the market so that you can determine profitable positions to enter or exit the market.Well if you are good in doing technical and fundamental analysis it's just very fine, the most common challenge is not setting your take profit and stop loss levels while carefully calculating the pips between the two points for risk ratio as part of your risk management measures.Now the other challenge of manual trading is that most of the time the time for entering or existing the market is often done imperfectly since you are using your own hands and time is fleeting.

<h4>A wide range of trading strategies</h4>
Well social trading provides investors with opportunity to access and make use of different trading strategies that they can replicate in their own forex trading accounts.This is awesome as investors can cormfotably diversify their portfolios to mitigate risks as part of their risk management measures.Investors can check on the profiles of their traders interns of descriptions of the strategies in brief,deposits, popularity interms of investors following the trader, deposits, profit rates,risk rates and profile pictures.

<h4>High transparency</h4>
Copy trading plartforms provide important information about the histories of the traders in a way that cannot be manipulated.This filters out the jokers and their fellow scammers in the financial markets providing the investors a more prudent plartform for investing their hard earned money.Most copy trading plartforms focuses on information about the traders such as the risk appetite, profits made, number of investors,lose made and their behaviour on certain events.
